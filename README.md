## Notes

### Boundaries

Possibly the most influential conference talk I've ever watched, this builds on many of the ideas presented in the Destroy All Software screencasts and really helped make separating the arrangement of work from the actual work click with me. It also has vastly impoved the testability, reliability and readability of my code. I don't see this approach as a silver bullet but I'll often reach for it when business logic gets overly complex.
